> Welcome to Project CM 👋, we're glad you're here! This project was born from our
community over at [codementoring.co](https://codementoring.co). The goal of this
project is to bring free, fun education to anyone who wants to learn how to code.

## ❓Why this project exists
We differ a little to other approaches and platforms with our unique focus on
storytelling. For us, stories are the bedrock of society and are how we've been
learning as humans since the dawn of time. In this project, all education, features,
new ideas and roadmaps have a focus on the story they tell. This is what makes
Code Mentoring, and this platform special. We think you'll like it too 😊.


## 🙋‍♀️ How you can get involved
Code Mentoring is an open community for all types and levels of develoeprs,
designers, hackers and tinkerers. If you want to get involved, or see something
you want to build (or even a bug fix), head over to our [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
document for more information.

> Please read our branching strategy in [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

> This is important if you want to contribute!

### 💬 Communication
We use our Slack community (`#project-cm` channel) for discussions on the project,
and Github projects for tracking issues.

### 📞 Weekly standup
We also have a **weekly standup call at 6pm EST** on Hangouts. Message one of the
maintainers for access to slack or to get a meeting invite.

## üîß What can I work on?

We use Github to track our issues. Look for any issues labelled `help wanted`. If
there is nobody assigned, comment that you'd like to take it over, and a maintainer
will assign you.

You can view [all issues needing help here](https://github.com/code-mentoring/learn/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

## üí¨ Communication

We use our Slack community (`#project-cm` channel) for discussions on the project,
and Github projects for tracking issues.

We also have a **weekly standup call at 6pm EST** on Hangouts. Message one of the
maintainers for access to slack or to get a meeting invite.

## üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Sprints

We do monthly sprints with weekly standups at 6pm EST on hangouts. This means
each month we deploy to master with all the PRs that were done that month.

## üå≥ Branches

We use the [Git Flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) branching
strategy to maintain the project. **PLEASE FOLLOW THIS FORMAT**

- `master` Production branch. Limited access on who can deploy to this
- `develop` Main development branch. We merge `feature/*` PRs into this branch
  once they're approved
- `feature/*` A feature branch aimed at addressing a SINGLE feature/fix. We try
  to keep these as SMALL AS POSSIBLE so our PR reviews are not to challenging. If
  a maintainer asks you to reduce your PR size, please do so.
- `release/vX.X.X` Used to release the sprints work into production.
